## A bit about me
I have been studying coding for a few years now. My background is actually in mental health nursing, and I am still doing this role, but I am looking to branch over into software development. I started off with learning Python, but have recently fallen in love with Java. 

I'm studying a part time degree in Software and Computing alongside working full-time as a nurse, so am hoping to make the transitions sometime int he not too distant future!

Oh, and my name is Daniella McSorley. Forgot that detail.
